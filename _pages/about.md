About Me
======

I am a Ph.D. student majoring in [Social & Engineering Systems and Statistics](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/) at MIT IDSS and LIDS. I have been fortunately working with [Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/) on machine learning for healthcare.

My current research centers around two primary questions:
* How can we mitigate the bias, hallucination, and miscalibration of language models, improving the deployability and ethics of these tools in real-world applications?
* How can we accurately and fairly assess the generation quality of language models, enabling decision-makers to make more informed choices in high-stakes scenarios?

For more information about my background and qualifications, please refer to [my CV](https://xiaoyuxin1002.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
